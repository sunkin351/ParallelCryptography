# ParallelCryptography
This library is a C# implementation of the MD5, SHA1, and SHA2 algorithms using advanced optimization techniques introduced into the .NET Core runtime. 
Parallel implementations rely on Compiler Intrinsics introduced in .NET Core 3+ for performance benefit.

SHA3 is planned to be implemented soon in the same way.
